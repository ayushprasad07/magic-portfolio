## Overview

Pingo is a real-time chatting application built for Android that enables users to securely connect and communicate with friends. It integrates Firebase services to provide real-time message updates, authentication, and persistent user data.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Leveraged Firebase Realtime Database to allow users to exchange messages instantly.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implemented Firebase Authentication to ensure user data is protected and only authorized users can access their accounts.
- **Friend Requests**: Built a system to send, accept, and manage friend requests, enabling user-specific conversations.
- **Delivery Status Indicators**: Added indicators to show message delivery and read status for enhanced communication feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: For Android app development with a concise and expressive syntax.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: To handle real-time data sync between users.
- **Firebase Authentication**: To manage user sign-in and security.
- **XML**: For designing responsive and structured UI layouts.

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing real-time communication required careful handling of asynchronous data flows and UI updates. Ensuring message delivery integrity and handling edge cases like lost connectivity or app background states helped deepen the understanding of Firebase data listeners and lifecycle management.

## Outcome

Pingo successfully delivers a seamless and secure chatting experience. With core social features and intuitive design, it serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements like media sharing, push notifications, and group chats.
